                    between the editor and the preview mode. You can finally customize everything on your website,
                    easily and directly.
                    Elementor is the editor for designers who want to fine-tune every last detail.

                </li>
                <li>Theme is compatible with <b>WPML</b>. By default, WordPress does not come with features required to
                    create a proper multilingual site. That's why WPML is the right solution to achieve this goal.
                    It offers an easy to use interface for managing translations. It also adds language switching
                    options for your users. You don’t need to do anything special to create multilingual-ready site.
                    Just use this theme and WPML takes care of the rest.
                    <p>In order to run the theme multilingual follow the steps below:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choose the version of WPML on <a
                                href="https://wpml.org/purchase/">https://wpml.org/purchase/</a>.<i>(Note: WPML is a
                                paid plugin, but it’s by far the most comprehensive option)</i>.</li>
                        <li>Download the WPML from your account and install all required components. For more details,
                            see step by step guide on <a
